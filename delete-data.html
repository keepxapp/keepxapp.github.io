        <h1>Compliance with Play Store Policy: Account and Data Deletion Request</h1>
    
        <p>At <strong>KeepX</strong>, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users. In line with the Google Play Store policy, which requires that apps provide users with an option to request the deletion of their account and associated data, we would like to clarify our approach.</p>
        
        <h2>How Data is Managed in KeepX</h2>
        
        <p>KeepX is designed to give users complete control over their data. Users can log in using Google Login to register or access their accounts. Importantly, all data generated or managed through KeepX is stored directly in the user's Google Drive account. We do not maintain any backend servers, nor do we store any personal data on our systems. This means that users' data is always within their control, stored securely in their personal Google Drive accounts.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Deletion Process</h2>
        
        <p>Given that we do not store any data on our servers, there is no need for an in-app data deletion feature. Users can easily manage and delete their data directly from their Google Drive account, where all KeepX-related data is stored.</p>
        
        <p>For users who wish to delete their account or the data associated with KeepX, they can follow these steps:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unlink KeepX from Google Drive</strong>: Users can go to their Google Account settings and navigate to the "Security" section. Under "Third-party apps with account access," they can find KeepX and choose to remove it. This action will revoke the app's access to their Google Drive, effectively preventing any further data storage or access by the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual Data Deletion</strong>: Users can manually delete any files or data associated with KeepX by accessing their Google Drive account. Simply locate the relevant files or folders and delete them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Commitment to Transparency and User Control</h2>
        
        <p>At KeepX, we are committed to ensuring that our users have full transparency and control over their data. As we do not collect or store any user data on our servers, KeepX is inherently designed to respect user privacy by giving them the autonomy to manage their own data.</p>
        
        <p class="contact">If you have any questions or require assistance with managing your data, please feel free to contact our support team at <a href="mailto:contact.keepx@gmail.com">contact.keepx@gmail.com</a>. We are here to help you with any concerns or questions you may have regarding your account or data.</p>
